## Generation

- [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) — initially from prompting gpt-5-pro to come up with a "novel" data structure
- Source code and [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) — prompting a gpt-5-codex agent to implement against the design, without understanding, with review loops from other LLMs

## Why?

To see what comes out when reflecting unverified designs and code through an AI hall of mirrors.
